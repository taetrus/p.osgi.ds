/**
 * <h2>Testing code that depends on other code: test doubles and Mockito</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Every other test in this project exercises an object that stands alone —
 * {@link Greet}, {@code Json}, {@code DockLayout}. Most production code is not like
 * that. {@link GreetHealthCheck} is the first subject with a <strong>collaborator</strong>:
 * at run time OSGi injects an {@link IGreet} into its private {@code greetService} field,
 * and {@code execute()} calls it. To test the health check we must decide what plays the
 * part of {@code IGreet}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Why not just use the real {@link Greet}?</h3>
 * <p>
 * We can, and the first test below does. But look at
 * {@code GreetHealthCheck.execute()}: it has a {@code catch} branch that reports
 * {@code CRITICAL} when the service throws. The real {@code Greet.greet()} never throws.
 * With the real object that branch is <em>unreachable</em> — we cannot test it, so we
 * cannot know it works. That is the honest, everyday reason for test doubles: to put
 * the code under test into situations its real collaborators cannot produce
 * (failures, timeouts, empty results, absurd values).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Vocabulary — the five kinds of test double</h3>
 * <p>
 * "Test double" is the umbrella term (as in "stunt double"). The names below are used
 * loosely in practice, but the distinctions are worth knowing:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Dummy</strong> — passed around but never used; exists only to fill a
 * parameter list.</li>
 * <li><strong>Stub</strong> — returns canned answers. "When asked X, say Y."</li>
 * <li><strong>Mock</strong> — a stub that also <em>records</em> how it was called, so
 * the test can ask "was {@code greet()} invoked exactly once?".</li>
 * <li><strong>Spy</strong> — a real object with recording wrapped around it.</li>
 * <li><strong>Fake</strong> — a working but simplified implementation (an in-memory
 * database in place of a real one).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Mockito's {@code mock()} produces something that can act as any of the first three,
 * which is why the word "mock" is used for all of them in daily speech.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>State testing vs interaction testing</h3>
 * <p>
 * The other tests in this project check <em>state</em>: call a method, look at the
 * returned value. A mock also allows checking <em>interactions</em>: did the code under
 * test talk to its collaborator, how many times, with what arguments? Prefer state
 * assertions when you can — they survive refactoring better. Interaction assertions are
 * the right tool when the interaction <em>is</em> the behaviour, as it is for a health
 * check whose whole job is "call the service once and report".
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>A mock is not magic</h3>
 * <p>
 * The tests are ordered as a story. First a test double written by hand in a few lines
 * of plain Java, to show that a mock is just a class you could write yourself. Then the
 * identical test using Mockito, so you can see exactly what the framework replaces (the
 * class) and what it adds (recording and verification). Finally the annotation style
 * that most real codebases use.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Reaching a private field</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@code GreetHealthCheck.greetService} is private and has no setter — OSGi's
 * Declarative Services injects it by reflection at run time. Our tests must do the
 * same, via {@link #healthCheckWith(IGreet)}. That small helper is a lesson in itself:
 * <em>field injection makes classes harder to test</em>. A constructor parameter or a
 * public setter would let the test hand over its double without reflection. The
 * {@code @InjectMocks} section at the end shows Mockito doing this reflection for you,
 * which is convenient — but it papers over the design smell rather than removing it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Where Mockito comes from, and that warning in the log</h3>
 * <p>
 * Mockito is an ordinary test-scope Maven dependency of this bundle (see
 * {@code pom.xml}; versions are managed in the parent). Like every {@code *Test} class
 * here it runs in a plain JVM, so no OSGi wiring is involved and nothing Mockito-related
 * ever enters the product. Mockito 5 defaults to the "inline" mock maker, which attaches
 * a Java agent to the running JVM and rewrites the mocked class's bytecode in place
 * instead of generating a subclass — that is why the test log prints a warning about
 * Mockito "self-attaching". The warning is expected. (ByteBuddy, the library doing the
 * rewriting, is pinned in the parent pom because the JVM that runs the tests locally may
 * be newer than the one on CI.)
 * </p>

     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>The void-method gotcha.</strong> Mockito's most familiar form is
     * {@code when(greet.greet()).thenThrow(...)}. That does not compile here, and the
     * reason is worth understanding rather than memorising: {@code when(...)} takes the
     * <em>return value</em> of the call as its argument. {@code greet()} returns
     * {@code void}, so there is no value to pass — the Java compiler rejects it before
     * Mockito even runs. For void methods the call must therefore come <em>after</em>
     * the stubbing instruction: {@code doThrow(x).when(mock).greet()}. The
     * {@code do...().when(mock)} family works for non-void methods too; some teams use
     * it everywhere for consistency.

     * Use this sparingly: it turns every future addition to the code into a test
     * failure. Here it is justified because a health check that called the service
     * twice would be doing twice the real work on every probe.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Note there is no {@code assert} in this test. The verification <em>is</em> the
     * assertion: {@code verify} throws if the record does not match.

    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    /**
     * Everything above, rewritten the way you will usually meet it. Three annotations
     * replace the manual wiring:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)} — plugs Mockito into JUnit 5's
     * lifecycle so the other two annotations are processed before each test. It also
     * enables <em>strict stubs</em>: a stub that a test sets up but never uses fails
     * that test, which catches copy-pasted setup that no longer means anything.</li>
     * <li>{@code @Mock} — the field is assigned {@code mock(IGreet.class)}.</li>
     * <li>{@code @InjectMocks} — the field is assigned {@code new GreetHealthCheck()},
     * and Mockito then pushes every {@code @Mock} into a matching field by type — the
     * same reflection {@link #healthCheckWith(IGreet)} does by hand, and the same thing
     * Declarative Services does at run time.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * This lives in a {@code @Nested} class so the extension applies only here; the
     * tests above deliberately show the wiring in the open. Each nested test still gets
     * a fresh outer instance, fresh mocks and a fresh health check.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A caution about {@code @InjectMocks}: it is silent when it fails. If the field
     * name or type changes so that nothing matches, the mock is simply not injected and
     * the test crashes with a {@code NullPointerException} in the code under test —
     * confusing until you know to look here first.
